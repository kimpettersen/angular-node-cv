ANGULARCV
=========

ANGULARCV is what it sounds like, my CV written in AngularJS. The backend is an REST API written in NodeJS and Express.

The API will be publically available once it is done. The CV will be presented with AngularJS, but also in a printable
format.
The project is developed using BDD


Why am I doing this?
