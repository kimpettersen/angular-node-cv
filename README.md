ANGULARCV
=========

ANGULARCV is what it sounds like, my CV written in AngularJS. The backend is an REST API written in NodeJS and Express.

The API will be publically available once it is done. The CV will be presented in form of a web application, with an 
easy way to print the page.

The project is developed using BDD


Why am I doing this? 
===================

Because writing both an API and an application in AngularJS, using BDD, have been on my bucketlist for a while.
