NOTES:

Start test env:
NODE_ENV=test node server/index.js

Run unittests:
mocha server/unittests --reporter spec -u bdd

Run e2e tests:
mocha server/e2e_tests --reporter spec -u bdd

Why not REST
each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client


Running e2e tests on test database screws up the content. restart server

Juggling

Test optimization

Document tests

e2e - imporioved html unit improved code

no after only afterEach jasmine
