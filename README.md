Angular-node-cv
===============

Angular-node-cv is what it sounds like, my CV written in AngularJS. The backend is an (almost)RESTful API written in NodeJS and Express.

Why am I doing this?
===================

There was many reasons. I was not satisfied with my testing skills, I wanted implement a REST api, and I wanted to learn Angular JS.
And I am also looking for a new job preferably in NYC.


What can you do with it?
========================

####Without installing anything you can:####


* Give me a job offer!
* Perform a GET request to the APU (There's list of things I want to do in the API)
* Look through the code
* Give me a code review or any type of feedback


####If you chose to install it you can also:####

* Run it locally
* Create, read, update and delete different items through the admin page and the API
* 


Requirements
============

* [Mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) running locally 
* [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) 0.8.x
